</h2>

<p>
There are two basic types of ttylinux installation, resulting in two type of
booted systems: a RAM disk or persistent storage.

<p>
A <b>Ram Disk</b> installation results in a system that puts the root file
system into RAM when it boots, which is what the bootable CD-ROM does. If you
want to put ttylinux onto a flash drive, pen drive, USB memory stick, travel
drive, etc. then you very probably want this sort of installation. This is
typical for flash drives, but not for spinning hard disks, for at least two
reasons: 1) flash drives have been much slower than hard drives, so maintaining
a live file system on a flash drive has been intolerably slow, and 2) these are
removable drive which have been difficult to consistently mount as they move
between interfaces and computers. With this booting scheme, the boot loader
takes the root file system from the drive and gives it to the kernel which
decompresses it and mounts it as a read/write root file system in a RAM disk in
memory. Changes to files in the root file system are lost when the system shuts
down; persistent changes must be stored elsewhere. However, ttylinux has
specific support for persistent changes to its boot-time startup with a RAM
disk system, this is described section <a href="node19.html#flashback">3.3.5</a>. The program
<tt>/sbin/ttylinux-flash</tt> can be used to copy ttylinux from the CD-ROM to
another drive and configure it to boot in this manner. The processes of putting
ttylinux onto a drive for booting a RAM disk system and configuring its
boot-time startup support is described in more detail in the next section
<a href="node14.html#bootflash">3.3</a>.

<p>
A <b>Persistent Storage</b> installation results in a system that boots with the
read/write root file system maintained directly on the spinning hard disk or
solid state drive. If you have a spinning hard disk or one of the new fast
solid state drives, and it is not removable, then you probably want this sort
of installation. If you want to install onto removable media and will move the
media to different slots or computers, then you do not want this kind of
installation. The program <tt>/sbin/ttylinux-installer</tt> can be used to install
ttylinux from the CD-ROM onto a spinning hard disk or solid state drive and
configure it to boot in this manner. The processes of installing ttylinux onto
a hard drive and booting a persistent storage root file system is described in
more detail in section <a href="node20.html#bootfixed">3.4</a>.
