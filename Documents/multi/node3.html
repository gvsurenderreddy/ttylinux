<span class="arabic">1</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> ttylinux Overview</a>
</h2>

<p>
ttylinux tries to use as little space as possible and be a familiar and
complete command-line Linux system, with fairly up-to-date Linux kernel and
program utilities. It provides multi-tasking, multi-user Linux with networking
capabilities in no more than 8 MB of disk space. It is prepared for Internet
access by Ethernet. A text-based web browser, command-line remote login secure
client and server, NFS client, FTP server, and TFTP server are a part of
ttylinux.

<p>
ttylinux can be installed onto a disk drive, both spinning hard drive or flash
drive such as a USB memory stick; it can be manually installed or installed by
using an installer script. Installation by installer script or manual
installation can be done with ttylinux itself or by using a different Linux
system.

<p>
The ttylinux file system, excluding the Linux kernel, is 8 MB in size. Using
the ttylinux installer script, a Linux kernel between 2.5 and 3.5 MB will also
be installed. This makes a minimum workable size of about 12 MB for a hard
drive partition on which to install ttylinux, although 32 MB of RAM are needed
to use the automated ttylinux installer script.

<p>
ttylinux includes a package management script, named <b>pacman</b>, capable of
<i>installing</i>, <i>making</i>, <i>removing</i> and <i>querying</i> ttylinux
packages and their files. The package manager can <i>list</i> and <i>install</i>
packages from an external repository via http. Pacman is useful for adapting
ttylinux to specific needs.

<p>
<b>What ttylinux Is Not</b>

<p>
ttylinux is not a typical Linux distribution; it does not have a graphical user
interface, software development tools, music player, document preparation nor
printing tools, databases nor network services such as BIND, News Server nor
Mail Transfer Agents.

<p>
<b>What ttylinux Can Do</b>

<p>
ttylinux is intended to be useful as the basis of an embedded system or a
directed-purpose system: with its small size ttylinux boots quickly from flash
drives and CR-ROM; it has been used as a system fix/repair tool, as a
simulation host, and is a good basis for a rescue or installation CD-ROM.

<p>
ttylinux provides a working Linux environment with its boot image, and custom
task-specific scripts can mount other parts of the file system to provide a
larger system.

<p>
ttylinux is useful on computers which are considered obsolete, such as 486SX
PC. It is for people who want to have a minimal Linux distribution to run when
little space is available or needed. Some users may want to use the ttylinux
file system but configure and build their own Linux kernel.

<p>
ttylinux can serve as a rough prototype of a larger system, since it uses the
same C library, glibc, as full Linux systems, compiling programs on a different
Linux computer and copying them to the ttylinux file system <span id="txt57">can</span>
result in working programs. <b>However this is not a supported feature.</b>
Programs compiled outside the normal ttylinux build process may require
libraries not present in ttylinux. Worse, they may be compiled on a computer
with different Linux kernel capabilities and make system calls not present in
ttylinux.

<p>
ttylinux is for people who have Linux experience; it is not for beginners,
unless you want to learn how a Linux system works underneath the Graphical User
Interfaces. You must be able to use the interactive shell command-line, and it
helps to know your way around Linux system. Most of the programs are
<b>busybox</b> programs; these are smaller versions of the common Unix utilities.
